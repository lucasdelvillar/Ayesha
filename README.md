## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

The focus of this project was to practice basic HTML and CSS skills and getting familiar/introduction into best practices such as seperation of concerns and responsive web design.

## Optimizations / Modifications

In terms of optimization I would go back and refractor my css. Some media quieries aren't needed so I can reduce my file size. I would compress all of my images and use "Lazy loading" since this page has quite a few high quality images. I would also re-write some of my rules to make them more modular i.e. using class selectors instead of combining class and element selectors.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use media queries to make my website more responsive.
